Nova is a 2d open-world pixel game (or at least is aiming to be). My goal with this game is to explore the capabilities of pygame but to also further challenge myself in making video games without a game engine. When I originally came up with the idea, I was considering using the Godot game engine which is a fantastic open-source game engine. However, I decided to use pygame due to the challenge it posed!

If you're considering contributing to the project, or even being part of the community or my other projects, you can go ahead and join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qFX6gdaUXc). I hope to you see you there soon!

I'll soon be adding a roadmap, and maybe even a project to help organize my thoughts a little.
